As I've got older its become harder to start new things.

Throughout my teens and 20's I became Good at things. In some areas, very good. As you get better at things you encounter people who aren't as good. That's obvious. But increasingly, more and more people are not as good as you. You can see the learning stage that they are in. As a viewer, you become more aware of others inadequecy. And as a follow on, you become more aware that other's can see yours.

As an adult, you expect more and are expected of more. You have a clearer sense of beginner and expert. You have an identity you are building or have already become known for. There is a fear that looking inadequate at one thing may translate to others.

Which makes it hard to start things. Like writing. But embarassement be damned, here is my first post of inadequecy.
