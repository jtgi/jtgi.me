Low effort, high dopamine products have messed with my productivity and ability to sustain deep work.

I notice this most when I'm trying to solve a problem. If I get stuck and explore a few different roads and am uncertain what trade offs to make I tend to instinctively open up something like Twitter.

Why? I think it's because not knowing creates some stress. Scrolling numbs it.

I don't like it.
